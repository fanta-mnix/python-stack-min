Stack in Python
===

Stack implementation in Python 2.7/3.5 that also returns the minimum value it holds. Operations `push`, `pop` and `min` are executed in constant time, a.k.a. O(1) time.

## Requirements
Python 2.7.x or Python 3.6.x installed.
You can get it [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) in case you don' already have it.

## Instructions
The code is available at the `stack.py` file, situated on the root folder of the project.

To execute the tests, run `python test_stack.py` in your command line.

## Troubleshooting
Make sure Python is installed correctly and is accessible in your PATH. You can confirm that by running `python --version` in your command line to see if it works.
